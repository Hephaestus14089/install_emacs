## Install Emacs
A simple shell script which contains commands to install GNU Emacs.<br/>But there are some steps to be followed before running this script.<br/>_Checking out the official documentation is highly recommended before proceeding with this short-cut._

## Steps :-
* Fetch the source code (the how of it is mentioned in the official docs)
* If you have clone the git repository, checkout to the desired function (or stay unstable, your wish)
* If needed, edit the install_emacs.sh file and change the _make -j_ option
```
make -j 4
```
and allot your desired number of threads
* Run the script

## Most importantly, Enjoy!
Thank you.
